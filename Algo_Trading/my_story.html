    I intend to be a quant-trader. And here is my story. Several conversations I had with professionals in my network caused me to reconsider a different career path. Yes, I once envisioned and worked towards an actuarial career, specifically on the life insurance track. I passed the SOA Probability exam, established connections with actuaries, and even applied to IABA (International Association of Black Actuaries).

<p id="company">
    Fortunately, I remained open-minded to career opportunities outside the actuarial track. When I discovered the magnificent overlap in the technical skills for actuaries and quants, I found more satisfaction within the scope of a quant’s career. Through conversations I had with my mentor, I learned impacting the business’ bottom line directly feels extremely rewarding because work assessed and measured by a P&L reinforces everyone’s accountability within that team. And no one wants to be on a losing team nor work with complacently underperforming teammates. Relying on quantitative driven decision making for market risk solutions sometimes requires new, creative, tested, but unconventional methods and modeling strategies. And I am confident in my ability to recognize how the market drivers influence trading cycles. Similarly, some life insurance actuaries unpack data on treasury yields, the business’ exposure to interest rate risk, and readjust pricing and reserves models for solvency. Once again, I am confident in writing SOA exams successfully and doing life insurance actuarial work. However, I want the energy, culture, and professional support that quant traders embrace at banks and asset management firms.

<p id="company">
    Upon graduation, I will be quant trading at a bank or asset management firm. I envision this vividly because I hedged commodities on a trade floor with my supervisor at Cargill years ago. Thanks to my internship experience and coach from Management Leadership for Tomorrow, I understand the sense of urgency and accuracy that traders must possess. Additionally, I envision passing the securities industry essentials exam, series 7 and series 57 within my first 6 - 8 months at the desk. I even reviewed half of the SIE study manual along with information from Investopedia for understanding technical jargon. Furthermore, I developed the habit to read market news articles from the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance. And I am grateful Baruch introduced the WSJ free to undergrads. Most recently, I began my software engineering course at Per Scholas to streamline enhancing my programming and I completed Tim Buchalka’s Python Masterclass successfully. Through Per Scholas’ 15-week course, I am building websites, application programming interfaces, and other projects through JavaScript, React, JSON, HTML, and CSS. Thanks to my python dedication, I have fully completed all the test inputs for over twenty Python HackerRank function implementation challenges.
