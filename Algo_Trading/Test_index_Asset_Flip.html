                <div class="theBack">This asset class offers ownership in publicly held companies.
                    Historically, this class outperformed other classes over long periods (Nonetheless, past
                    performance does not guarantee future results).
                    Stocks are among the most volatile securities throughout asset classes in the short term.
                    Returns and principal will fluctuate so that accumulations, when redeemed, may be worth more or less
                    than original cost.</div>

                <div class="theBack">This asset class generally pays a set rate of interest over a given period, then
                    returns the investor's principal.
                    Bonds pay interest (ie coupon payments or yield).
                    Bonds offer more stability than stocks in terms of volatility.
                    Value fluctuates due to current interest and inflation rates. 
                    They "guarantee risk-free" growth.

                    of exchange. Circulating banknotes and coins are currencies. They are traded between national markets.
                    Central banks determine the relative values of currencies. Currencies are defined by governments,
                    and each currency has limited
                    boundaries of acceptance. This includes global decentralized over-the-counter market for trading
                    currencies.

                    commercial RE shares. They help protect future purchasing power as property
                    values and rental income run parallel to inflation. They change slower than
                    stock and bond prices. They are subject to risks from fluctuating property
                    values, expenses, income, and environmental liabilities. Earn dividend income without
                    buying, managing, or financing properties.

                <div class="theBack">This asset class includes physical goods such as but not limited to gold, copper,
                    crude oil, natural gas,
                    wheat, corn, and even electricity.
                    Helps protect future purchasing power as values have fixed utility and thus run parallel to
                    inflation.
                    Values tend to exhibit low correlations with stock and bond prices.
                    Price dynamics are also unique: these become more volatile as prices rise. </div>

                    This underlying entity can be an asset, index, or interest rate.
                    These help insuring against price movements (hedging), increasing exposure to price movements
                    for speculation, and accessing hard-to-trade assets or markets.
